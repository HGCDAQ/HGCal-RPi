# HGCal-RPi

This repository contains the software and firmware to be placed on the Raspberry Pis.
A cleanup effort is being made on the `cleanup` branch.

There are two main files: `new_rdout` located in `RDOUT_BOARD_IPBus/rdout_software/` and `sync_debug` in `SYNCH_BOARD/`.
These two files act as helpers to facilitate the data collection process with IPBus.

## sync\_debug
This program prints out statistics to help with debugging while a run is being taken.
A typical printout is as follows (with comments after the hashes):
```
# these lines are printed at startup
version = 0x1105                                    # the fw version
constant = 0xbeef 0xdead                            # general constants
dummy = 0x1234 0xabcd
delay = 0x0008                                      # clock delay
cables_mask = 0x1000                                # mask showing connected cables
rdout_mask = 0x1000                                 # user-provided mask
max_count = 0x0000 0x0000
enable_veto = 0                                     # accept/ignore vetos
enable_trig = 1                                     # same for triggers

# these lines are printed once per loop
cables_mask = 0x1000
rdout_mask = 0x1000
loop =   0, waiting_for_trig = 0                    # are we waiting for the next trigger?
loop =   0, veto1 = 0                               # current veto status
loop =   0, veto2 = 0
loop =   0, rdout_done = 0                          # is the current readout done?
loop =   0, trig_reset = 0
loop =   0, maxed_out = 0
loop =   0, hold= 0xefff                            # mask telling which rdout boards are on hold
loop =   0, trigger = 0x0000 0x03e9       1001      # trigger count
```

## new\_rdout
This program facilitates the IPBus readout.
